For poke you only need printed parts and:

  - 2x M3x3 set screws (these will push the wires against the switch screws)

  - 2x M3x8 ideal for switch contacts (M3x6 to M3x12 should work as long as both are not longer than 20mm, for ex. 6+12, 6+10, 6+8, 6+6, 8+8, 8+10 and 10+10 should work as well)

  - 2x AWG24-30 wires (preferably silicone) long enough to get to the Head PCB 200mm is a good length to start with
  
assembly is the same as poke
